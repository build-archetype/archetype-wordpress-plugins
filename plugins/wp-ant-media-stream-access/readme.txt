Secure live stream access control with user tier-based routing and Rocket Chat integration for Ant Media Server.

== Description ==

Ant Media Stream Access provides advanced secure access control for live streams based on user tiers. Perfect for membership sites, educational platforms, and premium content delivery with integrated chat functionality.

**Key Features:**
* **Real-time Webhook Notifications** - TRUE 0-second stream detection (RECOMMENDED)
* Multi-tier access control (Platinum, Gold, Silver)
* JWT token authentication for secure streams
* WordPress user role and meta integration
* Rocket Chat integration with stream-based visibility
* Elementor widgets for easy layout design
* WordPress Heartbeat fallback monitoring (5-second intervals)
* Comprehensive debug logging and diagnostics

**Stream Access Control:**
Users are automatically assigned stream access based on their WordPress role or custom meta fields. The plugin supports three tiers: Platinum (premium content), Gold (standard content), and Silver (basic content).

**Rocket Chat Integration:**
Chat widgets automatically show/hide based on stream status. When streams are live, chat appears. When all streams are offline, chat is hidden. Perfect for live event engagement.

**Usage:**
Use the shortcode `[antmedia_stream]` to display streams based on user access level, or use the combined stream+chat Elementor widget for advanced layouts.

Supported shortcode parameters:
* `width="100%"` - Set player width  
* `height="450px"` - Set player height
* `format="hls"` - Stream format (hls, webrtc, embed)
* `controls="true"` - Show player controls
* `autoplay="false"` - Auto-play streams
