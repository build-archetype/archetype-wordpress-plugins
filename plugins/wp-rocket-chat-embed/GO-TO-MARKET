# Go-To-Market Plan: Rocket.Chat Embed for WordPress

## 1. Product Offering

- **Lite Version (Free):**

  - Listed on WordPress.org for maximum exposure.
  - Basic embedding of public Rocket.Chat channels via shortcode or Elementor widget.
  - No SSO or user sync.
  - Clear upgrade prompts to Pro.

- **Pro Version (Paid):**
  - Sold via Lemon Squeezy (handles payments, licensing, and updates).
  - Unlocks SSO, user sync, advanced customization, debug tools, and priority support.
  - Annual subscription for ongoing updates and support.

## 2. Launch Steps

- Prepare and submit Lite version to WordPress.org.
- Set up Lemon Squeezy store for Pro version sales and license management.
- Add upgrade prompts and license activation in the plugin.
- Create a landing page with feature comparison and purchase links.

## 3. Marketing Strategy

- **SEO & Content:** Blog posts, tutorials, and use-case guides targeting "WordPress chat", "Rocket.Chat WordPress integration", etc.
- **Partnerships:** Collaborate with Rocket.Chat, hosting providers, and WordPress agencies.
- **Social Proof:** Collect and display testimonials and case studies.
- **In-Plugin Upsell:** Prominent upgrade banners and feature comparisons in the Lite plugin settings.
- **Email List:** Capture leads for launch updates and Pro offers.

## 4. Support & Updates

- **Lite:** Community support via WordPress.org forums.
- **Pro:** Priority email support and regular updates via Lemon Squeezy licensing system.

## 5. Upgrade Path

- Users install Lite from WP.org.
- Upgrade prompts guide them to purchase Pro via Lemon Squeezy.
- After purchase, users receive a license key and download link.
- Pro plugin checks license for updates and support access.

## 6. Success Metrics

- Number of Lite installs and active sites.
- Conversion rate from Lite to Pro.
- Customer satisfaction and support response times.
- Revenue growth and renewal rates.

## 7. Freemium Model & Licensing Approach

- **Single codebase:** Both Lite and Pro features are included in the same plugin.
- **Distribution:**
  - The plugin is distributed for free via GitHub (and optionally WordPress.org for Lite exposure).
  - All users receive updates automatically via GitHub Updater or WP.org.
- **Pro Features:**
  - Pro features are locked and require a valid license key (sold via Lemon Squeezy) to unlock.
  - Users can upgrade at any time by purchasing a license and entering it in the plugin settings.
- **Licensing:**
  - Lemon Squeezy SDK is integrated for license validation and Pro unlocks.
  - No license = Lite features only; valid license = Pro features enabled.
- **Security:**
  - All code is visible, but value is in licensing, updates, and support (standard for WP plugins).
